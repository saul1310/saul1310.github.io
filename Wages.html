        <p1>In the article "Employers Steal Billions from Workers Paychecks Each Year" by David Cooper, the author presents data that sheds light on the issue of wage theft in the United States. The article examines the methods employers use to cheat workers out of their wages and provides estimates of the extent of this problem. 

            Regarding the gathering of the data, it is not explicitly stated how the data was collected. However, the author cites a number of sources including academic research, government agencies, and media reports. As long as the data collection process followed ethical guidelines, such as obtaining informed consent from participants and protecting their privacy, it can be considered ethical.
            
            There are both ethical and unethical uses of this data. Ethical uses include using the data to advocate for better working conditions for employees and to inform policymakers about the extent and severity of wage theft. On the other hand, unethical uses of this data could include using it to target and harass employers or to manipulate the labor market.
            
            To determine if data is being used ethically, it is important to consider a few key factors. First, the data should be accurate and reliable, and the methods used to collect and analyze it should be transparent and well-documented. Second, the data should be used in a way that respects the privacy and rights of the individuals it pertains to. Finally, the data should be used for a legitimate purpose that benefits society as a whole.
            
            Data scientists have a responsibility to society to use data ethically and responsibly. This includes taking steps to ensure that data is collected, analyzed, and used in a way that is transparent, accurate, and fair. Data scientists should also consider the potential impact of their work on individuals and society, and work to mitigate any negative consequences.
            
            In the case of the data presented in the article, it is important that policymakers and employers take action to address wage theft and improve working conditions for employees. Data scientists can play a role in this process by providing accurate and reliable data that can inform policy decisions and guide efforts to address this issue.
            
            In conclusion, the gathering of data for the article "Employers Steal Billions from Workers Paychecks Each Year" can be considered ethical if the data collection process followed ethical guidelines. There are both ethical and unethical uses of this data, and it is important to use it in a way that respects the privacy and rights of individuals and benefits society as a whole.
