    <b>technical issues </b>
    <p1>The article "When Are We Going to Have a Serious Conversation about How Unserious and Problematic SIGCSE Is?" raises important concerns about the SIGCSE (Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education) conference and the broader computing education community. The author argues that the conference is increasingly out of touch with the needs of the computing education community and fails to address critical issues, including diversity, equity, and inclusion in computing education.

        One of the key points made in the article is that SIGCSE is primarily focused on technical issues and fails to address broader issues that are important to the computing education community. For example, the author notes that the conference features very few sessions on diversity, equity, and inclusion in computing education, despite these being critical issues facing the field. This lack of attention to broader issues can create an exclusionary environment that fails to address the needs of underrepresented groups in computing.
        
        The article also raises concerns about the ethics of the computing education community, particularly in relation to the treatment of adjunct faculty and graduate students. The author argues that these groups are often exploited by universities and conference organizers, who expect them to work long hours for little pay and minimal recognition. This exploitation is particularly concerning in light of the broader issues facing the computing education community, as it can create a culture of exclusivity and privilege that further marginalizes underrepresented groups.
        
        Overall, the article highlights the need for a more serious conversation about the issues facing the computing education community, particularly in relation to diversity, equity, and inclusion. This conversation must address not only technical issues, but also broader ethical concerns, such as the treatment of adjunct faculty and graduate students. It is only by engaging in these conversations and taking action to address these issues that the computing education community can become more inclusive and equitable.
        
        In terms of ethical and unethical uses of data, it is essential to consider the impact of data on the individuals and communities being studied. Data should be gathered in a manner that is respectful and transparent, and should be used to address important issues and improve outcomes for underrepresented groups. However, data can also be used to perpetuate biases and discrimination, particularly when it is used to reinforce stereotypes or exclude certain groups.
        
        To conclude if data is being used ethically, it is important to consider the context in which it is being used, as well as the motivations of the researchers and the impact of the research on the individuals and communities being studied. Additionally, researchers should be transparent about their methods and should engage in ongoing reflection and dialogue to ensure that their research is conducted ethically.
        
        Data scientists have a responsibility to society to use data ethically and responsibly. This includes not only gathering and analyzing data in a respectful and transparent manner, but also using data to address important social issues and promote equity and inclusion. Additionally, data scientists should be mindful of the potential biases and limitations of their data, and should work to mitigate these biases to ensure that their research is as accurate and representative as possible.
        
        In conclusion, the article "When Are We Going to Have a Serious Conversation about How Unserious and Problematic SIGCSE Is?" raises important concerns about the computing education community, particularly in relation to diversity, equity, and inclusion. It highlights the need for a more serious conversation about these issues and the broader ethical concerns facing the field. By engaging in these conversations and taking action to address these issues, the computing education community can become more inclusive, equitable, and impactful.</p1>
