        <h2> The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas</h2>
        <i> Ursula K. Le guin</i>
        <p>--------------</p>
        <b> Introduction</b>
        <p>The city of Omelas is described as a utopian city that has any luxury the reader could imagine. They have no need for police or a military or a stock market, many things that are constants in our world. There are festivals, music and all kinds of things for the residents of Omelas to enjoy, and the narrator writes that they are truly happy in their city.There are drugs and alchohol for those who want it, however, the narrator states victory of life that is living in omelas is all that most people need, and that most do not need to use drugs. </p>
        <b> The child</b>
        <p> All of this joy and succsess however is contingent upon one resident of Omelas. There is a child In Omelas that is locked inside of a dark room, about the size of a closet, as cannot leave. The child is fearful and does not understand why it is where it is as it hasnt always been in this situation. This child is explained to be the source of the utopian societies peace and happiness, as is known to all the residents of omelas. It is stated that some of the residents of omelas come to see this child, while others dont feel the need to personally look at it. I wonder if their society would be different if everyone had to see the child, maybe semi- frequently so that the child does not lie out of mind. In this way, the suffering child is a metaphor for the concept of utilitarianism.</p>
        <b> Sacrifice</b>
        <p> The citizens of Omelas are all aware of the suffering that this child endures, and it is stgated that the sight of this child can be aggrivating for these citizens. They experience negative emotions that they thought they, as a society, had moved past, and many become angry. However, they know that their city relies on this childs suffering, and that the joys they experience are possible bevause this child feels the inverse. In this society the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, and it is a sacrifice that the citizens live with.</p>
        <b> The ones who walk away, and my theory on why</b>
        <p>Some of the citizens of Omelas do no abide by this fundamental law however. It is stated that there are times when an adolescent sees the child for the first time, and does not choose to try to ignore it and enjoy its gifts, but chooses to leave the city of omelas, and its utilitarian system.
            This is stated to also happen to people who have lived in Omelas their whole lives, falling silent for several days before leaving Omelas. My theory about this phenomenon is that the citizens of Omelas try to keep the child out of mind, and by not thinking about it they are able to forget the cost of their utopia. However if for some reason someone remembers the child, their illusion is broken, and it would be extremely hard to just go back to ignoring it, and so they leave.</p>
