<h1> Response to Ai use in Neurodivergent learning 


</h1>
<b> Personal thesis:
    I believe that while the use of AI can be incredibly useful in education as well as career related matters for neurodivergent individuals, the overuse of it and generalization of persons who are neruodivergent can lead to harmful side affects if used as one size fits all approach.
    </b>
<p1> This article is a very interesting update on the future of neurodivergent employment in the technical fields. While I understand the reasoning behind many of the new deverlopments, many of them also seem to be built upon generalizations regarding neurodivergent persons, and such raise some issues in my mind.</p1>
<p2> 
    The use of AI in an educational setting seems to address to differences in the learning styles of different students in a way that has never been seen before. In this sense, I think that the use of A.I in the classroom could be invaluable. Specifically, the ability to present students who are nonverbal with an AI avatar of themselves speaking is an idea that never crossed my mind, but strikes me as an incredibly interesting way to raise confidence in these students. Another use of AI in the  classroom setting is described as a way for teachers to make subtle nods through individual students screens, which could possibly alleviate some of the stress of feeling behind and asking questions.
    </p2>
<p3> However, the use of AI to perform an abstraction of information and form new paragraphs from other strikes me as possibly problematic. The idea of changing the words of a paragraph, even if it makes the concept more easily understandable strikes me as possibly harmful, and could lead to the wrong ideas or concepts being understood. By changing the formatting of the idea i believe that it is possible to lose intended ideas and nuances implied by the phrasing and organization of information.furthermore, I believe that in technical fields, the abstraction of information can be very damaging to overall understanding, as specifics in information as well as technical terms are key. In this regard I dont think incorporating AI into this field of work would be smart, however I agree with the rest of the uses mentioned in the article.</p3>
<p4> However, the section about current and planned accommodations for neurodivergent employees raises a couple of issues in my mind. The first point being managers apparently going through some kind of training to make their speech more understandable for neurodivergent employees. Once again citing abstraction as a way to increase understanding for neurodivergent persons, I feel that this generalization is not something that should be used by default, as everyone is different. One explanation that makes perfect sense to one person might just confuse another. Also, the suggestion to move neurodivergenrt employees into pirate offices to increase their productivity seems like another generalization. As someone who is neurodivergent myself, I get a lot more work done around other people. </p4>
<i> Side note: As someone who is neurodivergent, I think that the section about neurodivergent employee's affinity for repetitive tasks is very true. </i>
